`nvfetcher` is a tool to automate nix package updates. It's built on top of [shake](https://www.shakebuild.com/),
integrating [nvchecker](https://github.com/lilydjwg/nvchecker).
`nvfetcher` CLI program accepts a TOML file as config, which defines a set of package sources to run.

## Overview

For example, feeding the following configuration to `nvfetcher`:

```toml
# nvfetcher.toml
[rustdeck]
src.github = "rustdesk/rustdesk"
fetch.github = "rustdesk/rustdesk"
# Compute outputHashes for git dependencies in cargo lock
cargo_lock = ["Cargo.lock"]
```

You would get `_sources/generated.nix`:

```nix
# This file was generated by nvfetcher, please do not modify it manually.
{
  fetchgit,
  fetchurl,
  fetchFromGitHub,
  dockerTools,
}:
{
  rustdesk = {
    pname = "rustdesk";
    version = "1.4.2";
    src = fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "rustdesk";
      repo = "rustdesk";
      rev = "1.4.2";
      fetchSubmodules = false;
      sha256 = "sha256-b/KuWECsmEcz9nPiuPqCcGQ1p+GdbaELScaIXnUTGv8=";
    };
    cargoLock."Cargo.lock" = {
      lockFile = ./. + "/sha256-b_KuWECsmEcz9nPiuPqCcGQ1p+GdbaELScaIXnUTGv8=/Cargo.lock";
      outputHashes = {
        "filedescriptor-0.8.2" = "sha256-zXTt9eHAVdCPipWAMFeiqk1JteX+7IZcXZ7uvxkzDjQ=";
         # ...
      };
    };
  };
}


```

and `_sources/generated.json`:

```json
{
    "rustdesk": {
        "cargoLock": {
            "Cargo.lock": [
                "sha256-b_KuWECsmEcz9nPiuPqCcGQ1p+GdbaELScaIXnUTGv8=/Cargo.lock",
                {
                    "android-wakelock-0.1.0": "sha256-09EH/U1BBs3l4galQOrTKmPUYBgryUjfc/rqPZhdYc4=",
                    // ...
                }
            ]
        },
        "date": null,
        "extract": null,
        "name": "rustdesk",
        "passthru": null,
        "pinned": false,
        "src": {
            "deepClone": false,
            "fetchSubmodules": false,
            "leaveDotGit": false,
            "name": null,
            "owner": "rustdesk",
            "repo": "rustdesk",
            "rev": "1.4.2",
            "sha256": "sha256-b/KuWECsmEcz9nPiuPqCcGQ1p+GdbaELScaIXnUTGv8=",
            "sparseCheckout": [],
            "type": "github"
        },
        "version": "1.4.2"
    }
}
```

We tell `nvfetcher` how to get the latest version number of packages and how to fetch their sources given version numbers,
and `nvfetcher` will help us keep their version and prefetched SHA256 sums up-to-date, producing ready-to-use nix expressions in `_sources/generated.nix`.

`nvfetcher` reads `generated.json` to produce version change messages, such as `feeluown: 3.8.1 → 3.8.2`.
Versions of packages are always checked during each run, but only do prefetch and further operations when needed.

### Live examples

How to use the generated sources file? Here are several examples:

- My [flakes repo](https://github.com/berberman/flakes)

**Add your own flakes repo here if you want to share it with others!**

## Installation

`nvfetcher` package is available in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs), so you can try it with:

```
$ nix-shell -p nvfetcher
```

This repo also has flakes support:

```sh
$ nix run github:berberman/nvfetcher
```

To use it as a Haskell library, the package is available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvfetcher).
If you want to use the Haskell library from flakes, there is also a shell `ghcWithNvfetcher`:

```sh
$ nix develop github:berberman/nvfetcher#ghcWithNvfetcher
$ runghc Main.hs
```

where you can define packages in `Main.hs`. See [Haskell library](#Haskell-library) for details.

## Usage

Basically, there are two ways to use `nvfetcher`, where the difference is how we provide package sources definitions to it.

### CLI

To run `nvfetcher` as a CLI program, you'll need to provide package sources defined in TOML.

```
Usage: nvfetcher [--version] [--help] [-o|--build-dir DIR] [--commit-changes] 
                 [-l|--changelog FILE] [-j NUM] [-r|--retry NUM] [-t|--timing] 
                 [-v|--verbose] [-f|--filter REGEX] [-k|--keyfile FILE] 
                 [--keep-old] [--keep-going] [TARGET] [-c|--config FILE]

  generate nix sources expr for the latest version of packages

Available options:
  --version                Show version
  --help                   Show this help text
  -o,--build-dir DIR       Directory that nvfetcher puts artifacts to
                           (default: "_sources")
  --commit-changes         `git commit` build dir with version changes as commit
                           message
  -l,--changelog FILE      Dump version changes to a file
  -j NUM                   Number of threads (0: detected number of processors)
                           (default: 0)
  -r,--retry NUM           Times to retry of some rules (nvchecker, prefetch,
                           nix-build, etc.) (default: 3)
  -t,--timing              Show build time
  -v,--verbose             Verbose mode
  -f,--filter REGEX        Regex to filter packages to be updated
  -k,--keyfile FILE        Nvchecker keyfile
  --keep-old               Don't remove old files other than generated json and
                           nix before build
  --keep-going             Don't stop if some packages failed to be fetched
  TARGET                   Three targets are available: 1.build 2.clean (remove
                           all generated files) 3.purge (remove shake db)
                           (default: build)
  -c,--config FILE         Path to nvfetcher TOML config
                           (default: "nvfetcher.toml")
```

Each package corresponds to a TOML table: name is encoded as table key, with
two required fields and three optional fields in each table.
You can find an example of the configuration file, see [`nvfetcher_example.toml`](nvfetcher_example.toml).

### Keyfile

You can specify `nvchecker` keyfile via command line option.
For the format of this file, please refer to [nvchecker documentation](https://nvchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#configuration-table).

#### Nvchecker

Version source -- how do we track upstream version updates?

- `src.github = owner/repo` - the latest github release
- `src.github_tag = owner/repo` - the max github tag, usually used with list options (see below)
- `src.pypi = pypi_name` - the latest pypi release
- `src.git = git_url` (and an optional `src.branch = git_branch`) - **the latest commit** of a repo
- `src.archpkg = archlinux_pkg_name` -- the latest version of an archlinux package
- `src.aur = aur_pkg_name` -- the latest version of an aur package
- `src.manual = v` -- a fixed version, which never updates
- `src.repology = project:repo` -- the latest version from repology
- `src.webpage = web_url` and `src.regex` -- a string in webpage that matches with regex
- `src.httpheader = request_url` and `src.regex` -- a string in http header that matches with regex
- `src.openvsx = publisher.ext_name` -- the latest version of a vscode extension from open vsx
- `src.vsmarketplace = publisher.ext_name` -- the latest version of a vscode extension from vscode marketplace
- `src.cmd = cmd` -- the version from a shell command (e.g. `echo Meow`)
- `src.container = owner/name` - the latest tag of a container from the Docker registry

Optional list options for some version sources (`src.github_tag`, `src.webpage`, and `src.httpheader` and `src.container`),
see the corresponding [nvchecker documentation](https://nvchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#list-options) for details.

- `src.include_regex`
- `src.exclude_regex`
- `src.sort_version_key`
- `src.ignored`

Optional global options for all kinds of version sources,
see the corresponding [nvchecker documentation](https://nvchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#global-options) for details. You can tweak obtained version number using this option, e.g. stripping the prefix `v` or transforming the result by regex.

- `src.prefix`
- `src.from_pattern`
- `src.to_pattern`

#### Nix fetcher

How do we fetch the package source if we have the target version number?
`$ver` is available in string, which will be set to the result of nvchecker.

- `fetch.github = owner/repo`
- `fetch.pypi = pypi_name`
- `fetch.git = git_url`
- `fetch.url = url`
- `fetch.openvsx = publisher.ext_name`
- `fetch.vsmarketplace = publisher.ext_name`
- `fetch.tarball = tarball_url`
- `fetch.docker = owner/name`

Optional config for `nix-prefetch-url`, applies when the fetcher equals to `fetch.url`.
`$ver` is available in string, just like for the fetch config.

- `url.name = file_name`

Optional config for `nix-prefetch-git`, applies when the fetcher equals to `fetch.github` or `fetch.git`.

- `git.deepClone`
- `git.fetchSubmodules`
- `git.leaveDotGit`

Optional config for `fetch.docker`/`dockerTools.pullImage`:

- `docker.os`
- `docker.arch`
- `docker.finalImageName`
- `docker.finalImageTag`
- `docker.tlsVerify`

#### Extract source files

Optional source extracting config, files are extracted into build directory.

- `extract = [ "glob_1", "glob_2", ...]` - globs are relative to the source root

Each glob will be resolved to a list of files matching the pattern.
For each matching file, `nvfetcher` copies it to the build directory, and generates `extract.<file_name> = ./. + "<path>"` entry in the nix expr.

Recursive globs are supported, e.g. one can write `extract = [ "**/*" ]` to pull all files in a package to build directory. 
See [Glob](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Glob-0.10.2/docs/System-FilePath-Glob.html#v:compile) for details.

Note: Directories are ignored.

#### Rust support

`rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` now accepts an attribute [`cargoLock`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/doc/languages-frameworks/rust.section.md#importing-a-cargolock-file) to vendor dependencies from `Cargo.lock`,
so we can use this instead of TOFU `cargoSha256` for Rust packaging. `nvfetcher` supports automating this process,
extracting the lock file to build and calculating `cargoLock.outputHashes`, as long as you set the config.
There can be many lock files in one source.

- `cargo_lock = [ "cargo_lock_glob_1", "cargo_lock_glob_2", ...]` - globs are relative to the source root

Similar to extract, cargo locks will be pulled into build directory.

#### Passthru

_passthru_ config, an additional set of attrs to be generated.

- `passthru = { k1 = "v1", k2 = "v2", ... }`

Note: currently the values can only be strings

#### Pinned

If a package is pinned, we call nvchecker to check the new version iff there's no existing version.

- `pinned = true`

#### Git commit date

If the version source of a package is `git`, nvfetcher can finds out the commit date of this revision,
in the format of `%Y-%m-%d` by default. You can provide your own [`strftime`](https://strftime.org/) format:

- `git.date_format = "strftime_format"`
- `git.date_tz = "timezone"`

You can use the `git.time_zone` option to specify the time zone for the commit date. Accepts IANA time zone names, e.g. `git.time_zone = "America/New_York"`. Plus, you can use `git.time_zone = "local"` to refer to the local time zone.

#### Force fetching

Always fetch the package, even if its version (nvchecker output) doesn't change.
This is useful when the file to be downloaded cannot not be determined by the url.

- `fetch.force = true`

> Note: In such case, nvfetcher will not produce a version change log, since the version doesn't change at all.
> Only sha256 in generated files will be updated.

### Haskell library

nvfetcher itself is a Haskell library as well, whereas the CLI program is just a trivial wrapper of the library.
You can create a Haskell program depending on it directly, by using the `runNvFetcher` entry point.
In this case, we can define packages in Haskell language, getting rid of TOML constraints.

You can find an example of using nvfetcher in the library way, see [`Main_example.hs`](Main_example.hs).
